# 2. Focus on theory or application for machine learning

* Status: accepted <!-- optional -->
* Date: 2018-05-31 <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

To generate good machine learning application I need to understand the theory like linear algebra, statistics .... On the other side I want to show people some samples and I have more fun apply it. 

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* [driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
* … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* Code-along with AWS Sagemaker
* Do Machine Learning Courses

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Code-along with AWS Sagemaker", because I will start with a code along with AWS Sagemaker and my own application. As I want to check if I can use it without deep knowledge and can go back to theory if required.

Positive Consequences: <!-- optional -->
* [e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, …]

Negative consequences: <!-- optional -->
* I will have to check if good results can be achieved without knowing the basics. If not I will have to check which course might give me the shortest way to become productive.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Code-along with AWS Sagemaker

* Good, because I have something to show
* Good, because I have fun
* Bad, because I might not understand what I do
* Bad, because I might miss some basics for the discussions at work

### Do Machine Learning Courses

* Good, because I learn the basics
* Bad, because I don't have something to show
* Bad, because I have less fun - and get bored and do other things

## Links <!-- optional -->

* [Link type] [Link to ADR] <!-- example: Refined by [ADR-0005](0005-example.md) -->
* … <!-- numbers of links can vary -->
