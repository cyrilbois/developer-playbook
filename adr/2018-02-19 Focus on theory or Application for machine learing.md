# _Focus on theory or application for machine learning_

To generate good machine learning application I need to understand the theory like linear algebra, statistics .... On the other side I want to show people some samples and I have more fun apply it. 

## Considered Alternatives

* Code-along with AWS Sagemaker
* Do Machine Learning Courses

## Decision Outcome

* Chosen Alternative: Code-along with AWS Sagemaker

* _I will start with a code along with AWS Sagemaker and my own application. As I want to check if I can use it without deep knowledge and can go back to theory if required._

* _I will have to check if good results can be achieved without knowing the basics. If not I will have to check which course might give me the shortest way to become productive._

## Pros and Cons of the Alternatives

### Code-along with AWS Sagemaker

* `+` I have something to show. 
* `+` I have fun.
* `-` I might not understand what I do. 
* `-` I might miss some basics for the discussions at work. 

### Do Machine Learning Courses

* `+` I learn the basics.
* `-` I don't have something to show. 
* `-` I have less fun - and get bord and to other things.
