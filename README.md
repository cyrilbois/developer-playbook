# Serverless Tutorial

I write this in **January 2018** while I am working on the best stack to build modern applications fast. I currently working for a large insurance company and maintaining the tech stack is a pain. therefore the benefits of serverless have a huge potential to increase the speed. But there are many technology choices in the serverless ecosystem - and there is no right question to a "best tech stack" question it always depends. For me the following made sense:  

* What cloud provider to chose? I go for the largest provider as the ecosystem helps me from learning to open source assets and libaries. Currently **AWS** is the biggest serverless cloud provider also compared to Google \(the other big option\) they offer serverless functions for other languages then Javascript. Further you can integrate for specific function other cloud providers like Google for Analytics.
* Python: best for backend because of the nice analytics integration, aws build their own framework chalice for serverless in python, and fastest startup time
* Javascript in the frontend.
